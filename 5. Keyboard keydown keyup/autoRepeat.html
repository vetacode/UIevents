<!-- Auto-repeat
If a key is being pressed for a long enough time, it starts to “auto-repeat”: the keydown triggers again and again, and then when it’s released we finally get keyup. So it’s kind of normal to have many keydown and a single keyup.

For events triggered by auto-repeat, the event object has:

event.repeat property set to true. -->
