<!-- Pointer Events allow handling multi-touch with the help of the pointerId and isPrimary properties.

Here’s what happens when a user touches a touchscreen in one place, then puts another finger somewhere else on it:

At the first finger touch:
1. pointerdown with isPrimary=true and some pointerId.
2. For the second finger and more fingers (assuming the first one is still touching): 
  pointerdown with isPrimary=false and a different pointerId for every finger. -->
