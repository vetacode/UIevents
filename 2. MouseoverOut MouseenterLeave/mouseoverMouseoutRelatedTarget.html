<!-- These events are special, because they have property relatedTarget. This property complements target. When a mouse leaves one element for another, one of them becomes target, and the other one – relatedTarget.

For mouseover:

event.target – is the element where the mouse came over.
event.relatedTarget – is the element from which the mouse came (relatedTarget → target).
For mouseout the reverse:

event.target – is the element that the mouse left.
event.relatedTarget – is the new under-the-pointer element, that mouse left for (target → relatedTarget). -->
